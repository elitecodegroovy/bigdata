         <p>

             The Apache™ Hadoop® project develops open-source software for
             reliable, scalable, distributed computing.

         </p>

         <p>

             The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that
             allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters
             of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up
             from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local
             computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver
             high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle
             failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available
             service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to
             failures.

         </p>
         <p>
             The project includes these modules:
         </p>
         <ul>

             <li>
                 <strong>Hadoop Common</strong>:
                 The common utilities that support the other Hadoop modules. </li>


             <li>
                 <strong>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS™)</strong>:
                 A distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to application data.</li>


             <li>
                 <strong>Hadoop YARN</strong>:
                 A framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.</li>


             <li>
                 <strong>Hadoop MapReduce</strong>:
                 A YARN-based system for parallel processing of large data sets.</li>

         </ul>
         <p>Other Hadoop-related projects at Apache include:</p>

                 HCatalog, HBase, ZooKeeper, Oozie, Pig and Sqoop. Ambari also provides
                 a dashboard for viewing cluster health such as heatmaps and ability to
                 view MapReduce, Pig and Hive applications visually alongwith features to
                 diagnose their performance characteristics in a user-friendly manner.</li>
